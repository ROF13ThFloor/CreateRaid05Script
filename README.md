# RAID5 Linux 
In RAID 5, data strips across multiple drives with distributed parity. The striping with distributed parity means it will split the parity information and stripe data over the multiple disks, which will have good data redundancy.

For RAID Level it should have at least three hard drives or more. RAID 5 is being used in the large-scale production environment where itâ€™s cost-effective and provides performance as well as redundancy.
